  Welcome to the official repository for the IESD Hack Day event.
</p>







## **Tasks**

**Objective 1:** (20 pts) Provide a mechanism to encode arbitrary standard ASCII text strings as DNA.  Recall that ASCII characters have numeric values of 0 to 255.

Input: a, Output: TGAT              

Input: cat, Output: TGACTGATTCTA

**Objective 2:** (30 pts) Using your favorite unit test framework, write the unit tests you feel are necessary to adequately test the code you wrote as your answer to object one.

**Objective 3:** (30 pts) Create a simple user interface for users to interact with your program - input/output for your program. 

**Objective 4:** (30 pts) RNA is very similar to DNA, but it replaces T with U.  Make your program capable of encoding as either DNA or RNA.

**Objective 5:** (40 pts) Provide an interface for identifying standard ASCII text substrings encoded as DNA; the interface should provide the zero-based index where the substring begins or -1 if it does not exist.

**Objective 6:** (40 pts) DNA actually consists of two, complementary strands that are attached in such a way that every A matches T and G matches C (and the inverses).  Given a complementary strand of DNA, output the ASCII equivalent of the primary strand.

Examples:

Input: ACTGACTAAGAT, Output: cat

**Objective 7:** (50 pts) Add the ability to log all requests. Store the input, the time it took to convert it from ASCII text to DNA or RNA, output and a time stamp. 

**Objective 8:** (80 pts) Given two (single) strands of DNA, provide an interface that allows finding the longest common subsequence of the two. Recall that common subsequences need not be consecutive.


## **Innovation** 
Have an idea for an innovative feature for this project? Each accepted innovation that is completed will earn you a total of 50 points.  

**Innovations must meet the following criteria:**
- Must have completed at least 70% of all objectives
- Must be a new idea (creative and original) - talk to an organizer first
- Must not cause any regression in user experience

## **Scoring**

Based on the point system under tasks, you will also be on the hook for an **additional 10 points**. Your project will be reviewed and given points (not deducted points) if any of the factors below are met or exceeded. 

**Factors in scoring:**
- Code simplicity
- Documentation
- Code commenting
- UI Design / Visualization Design
- Presentation
- Teamwork
- Collaboration (Git & GitHub commit messages, PRs, comments, review, etc)

Simplicity will be favored over complex/clever code. Commenting code will also be highly favored.
